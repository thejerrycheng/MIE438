# MIE438_LED_cubic_console! 

This is an instruction of how to setup your own 8*8*8 LED game console. As there are tons of build-videos out there on YouTube. This report will only focus on the 

circuit design and the software aspect on how to light up the cube. Those two aspects were the consierably most challenging parts of the projects. 
In addition, it will walk through the two games created for the cube: Snake and Pong, two most classic console games of all time! (BUT in 3D!)
Lots of embedded system to be discovered. Let's dive into the lowest levels!
